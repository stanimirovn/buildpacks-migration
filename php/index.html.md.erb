### <a id='quick_start'></a> 30 Second Tutorial ###

Getting started with this buildpack is easy.  With the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) installed, open a shell, change directories to the root of your PHP files and push your application using the argument `-b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack.git`.

Example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ mkdir my-php-app
$ cd my-php-app
$ cat << EOF > index.php
&lt;?php
  phpinfo();
?&gt;
EOF
$ cf push -m 128M -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/php-buildpack.git my-php-app
</pre>

Change **my-php-app** in the above example to a unique name on your target Cloud Foundry instance to prevent a hostname conflict error and failed push.

The example above creates and pushes a test application, **my-php-app**, to Cloud Foundry. The `-b` argument instructs CF to use this buildpack. The remainder of the options and arguments are not specific to the buildpack, for questions on those consult the output of `cf help push`.

Here's a breakdown of what happens when you run the example above.

  - On your PC:
    - It will create a new directory and one PHP file, which just invokes `phpinfo()`
    - Run `cf` to push your application.  This will create a new application with a memory limit of 128M (more than enough here) and upload our test file.
  - Within Cloud Foundry:
    - The buildpack is executed.
    - Application files are copied to the `htdocs` folder.
    - Apache HTTPD & PHP are downloaded, configured with the buildpack defaults and run.
    - Your application is accessible at the URL `http://my-php-app.example.com` (Replacing `example.com` with the domain of your public CF provider or private instance).

### <a id='more_info'></a> More information about deploying ###
While the *30 Second Tutorial* shows how quick and easy it is to get started using the buildpack, it skips over quite a bit of what you can do to adjust, configure and extend the buildpack.  The following sections and links provide a more in-depth look at the buildpack.


### <a id='features'></a> Features ###

Here are some special features of the buildpack.

  - Supports running commands or migration scripts prior to application startup.
  - Supports an extension mechanism that allows the buildpack to provide additional functionality.
  - Allows for application developers to provide custom extensions.
  - Easy troubleshooting with the `BP_DEBUG` environment variable.
  - Download location is configurable, allowing users to host binaries on the same network (i.e. run without an Internet connection)
  - Smart session storage, defaults to file w/sticky sessions but can also use redis for storage.

### <a id='examples'></a> Examples ###

Here are some example applications that can be used with this buildpack.

  - [php-info]  This app has a basic index page and shows the output of `phpinfo()`.
  - [PHPMyAdmin]  A deployment of PHPMyAdmin that uses bound MySQL services.
  - [PHPPgAdmin] A deployment of PHPPgAdmin that uses bound PostgreSQL services.
  - [Drupal] A deployment of Drupal that uses bound MySQL service.
  - [CodeIgniter]  CodeIgniter tutorial application running on CF.
  - [Stand Alone]  An example which runs a standalone PHP script.
  - [pgbouncer]  An example which runs the PgBouncer process in the container to pool database connections.

## <a id='proxy_support'></a> Proxy Support ##

If you need to use a proxy to download dependencies during staging, you can set
the `http_proxy` and/or `https_proxy` environment variables. For more information, see
the [Proxy Usage Docs](../proxy-usage.html).

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

For versions of PHP 5.6.0 and later, the default certificate location is `/usr/lib/ssl/certs`, which symlinks to `/etc/ssl/certs`.
Your platform operator can configure the platform to [add the custom certificates into the application container](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/trusted-system-certificates.html).
