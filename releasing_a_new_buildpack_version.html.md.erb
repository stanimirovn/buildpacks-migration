title: Releasing a New Buildpack Version
owner: Buildpacks
---



This topic describes how to update and release a new version of a Cloud Foundry (CF) buildpack through the CF Buildpacks Team Concourse [pipeline](https://buildpacks.ci.cf-app.com/). Concourse is a continuous integration (CI) tool for software development teams. This is the process used by the CF Buildpacks Team and other CF buildpack development teams. You can use this process as a model for using Concourse to build and release new versions of your own buildpacks.

The Concourse pipelines for Cloud Foundry buildpacks are located in the [buildpacks-ci](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpacks-ci) GitHub repository.

To release a new buildpack version, perform the following:

1. Ensure you have downloaded the `buildpacks-ci` repository:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ git clone https<span>:</span>//github.com/cloudfoundry/buildpacks-ci.git
  </pre>

1. From the buildpack directory, check out the `develop` branch of the buildpack:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cd /system/path/to/buildpack
  $ git checkout develop
  </pre>

1. Ensure you have the most current version of the repository:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ git pull -r
  </pre>

1. Run `bump` to update the version in the buildpack repository:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ /system/path/to/buildpacks-ci/scripts/bump
  </pre>

1. Modify the `CHANGELOG` file manually to condense recent commits
into relevant changes. For more information, see [Modify Changelogs](#changelogs).

1. Add and commit your changes:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ git add VERSION CHANGELOG
  $ git commit -m "Bump version to $(cat VERSION) [{insert story #}]"
  </pre>

1. Push your changes to the `develop` branch:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ git push origin develop
  </pre>

##<a id="concourse"></a>Concourse Buildpack Workflow

If `buildpacks-ci` is not deployed to Concourse, manually add
a Git tag to the buildpack and mark the tag as a release on GitHub. 

If `buildpacks-ci` is deployed to Concourse, the buildpack update passes through the following life cycle:

1. Concourse triggers the `buildpack-to-master` job in the pipeline for the updated buildpack. This job merges develop onto the master or main branch of the buildpack.

1. The `detect-new-buildpack-and-upload-artifacts` job triggers in the pipeline for the updated buildpack. This job creates a cached and uncached buildpack and uploads them to an AWS S3 bucket. 

1. The `specs-lts-master` and `specs-edge-master` jobs trigger and
run the buildpack test suite and the buildpack-specific tests of the [Buildpack Runtime Acceptance Tests (BRATS)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/brats).

1. If you are using [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com), paste the links for
the `specs-edge-master` and `specs-lts-master` builds in the related buildpack release story
and deliver that story.

1. Your project manager can manually trigger the `buildpack-to-github` job on Concourse as part
of the acceptance process. This releases the buildpack to GitHub.

1. After the buildpack has been released to GitHub, the `cf-release` pipeline is triggered using the manual trigger of
the `recreate-bosh-lite` job on that pipeline. If the new buildpack has been released to GitHub, the CF that
is deployed for testing in the `cf-release` pipeline is tested against that new buildpack. 

1. After the `cats` job has successfully completed, your project manager can ship the new buildpacks to the `cf-release` repository and create the new buildpack BOSH release by manually triggering the `ship-it` job.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If errors occur during this workflow, you may need to remove unwanted tags. For more information, see <a href="#dealing-with-unwanted-tags">Handle Unwanted Tags</a>.</p>

##<a id="changelogs"></a>Modify Changelogs

The [Ruby Buildpack changelog](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ruby-buildpack/blob/master/CHANGELOG) shows an example
layout and content of a changelog. In general, changelogs follow these conventions:

- Reference public tracker stories whenever possible.
- Exclude unnecessary files
- Combine and condense commit statements into individual stories containing valuable changes.

##<a id="dealing-with-unwanted-tags"></a>Handle Unwanted Tags

If you encounter problems with the commit that contains the new version, change the target of the release tag by performing the following:

1. Ensure the repository is in a valid state and is building successfully.
1. Remove the tag from your local repository and from GitHub.
1. Start a build. The pipeline build script should re-tag the build if it is successful.
