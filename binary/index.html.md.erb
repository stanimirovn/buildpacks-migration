title: Binary Buildpack
---


Use the binary buildpack for running arbitrary binary web servers.

## <a id='pushing_apps'></a> Push an App ##

Specify the binary buildpack to stage an app as a binary file.
On a command line, use `cf push MY-AWESOME-APP` with the `-b` option to specify the
buildpack.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push MY-AWESOME-APP -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack.git
</pre>

You can provide Cloud Foundry with the shell command to execute your binary in
the following two ways:

* **Procfile**: In the root directory of your app, add a `Procfile` that
specifies a `web` task:

    ```yaml
    web: ./app
    ```
* **Command line**: Use `cf push MY-AWESOME-APP` with the `-c` option:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf push MY-AWESOME-APP -c './app' -b binary_buildpack
    </pre>

## <a id='compiling'></a> Compile your Binary ##
Cloud Foundry expects your binary to bind to the port specified by the `PORT`
environment variable.

The following example in [Go](https://golang.org/) binds a binary to the PORT
environment variable:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s", "world!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":"+os.Getenv("PORT"), nil)
}
```

Your binary should run without any additional runtime dependencies on the
cflinuxfs3 or lucid64 root filesystem (rootfs).
Any such dependencies should be statically linked to the binary.

To boot a Docker container running the cflinuxfs3 filesystem, run the following
command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ docker run -it cloudfoundry/cflinuxfs3 bash
</pre>

To boot a Docker container running the lucid64 filesystem, run the following
command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ docker run -it cloudfoundry/lucid64 bash
</pre>

To compile the above Go application on the rootfs, golang must be installed. `apt-get install golang` and `go build app.go` will produce an `app` binary.

When deploying your binary to Cloud Foundry, use `cf push` with the `-s` option to specify the root filesystem it should run against.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push MY-AWESOME-APP -s (cflinuxfs3|lucid64)
</pre>

## <a id='bosh_trusted_cert'></a>BOSH Configured Custom Trusted Certificate Support ##

Your platform operator can configure the platform to add the custom certificates into the application container.
The custom trusted certificates are added to the `/etc/ssl/certs` directory and can be used by binary applications.

For more information, see [Configuring Trusted System Certificates for Applications](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/running/trusted-system-certificates.html).

## <a id='dotnet-console'></a>.NET Apps

**.NET Core on Windows**

To run .NET Core apps on the Windows stack, you must use the Binary buildpack. Follow the steps below to configure your
Cloud Foundry manifest appropriately.

1. In the app manifest file, specify the `windows` stack and a custom start command. 
This file should be in the same folder as your `.csproj` file and be marked **copy always**.  

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: MY-AWESOME-APP
      stack: windows
      command: cmd /c .\MY-AWESOME-APP --urls=http://0.0.0.0:%PORT%
    ```

1. Publish the project using the dotnet CLI or Visual Studio.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ dotnet publish -o ./publish -r win10-x64 -f netcoreapp2.1
    </pre>

1. A `publish` folder should now exist. Navigate to this `publish` folder and verify the `manifest.yml` file exists. Run `cf push` to deploy your app.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cd publish
    $ cf push MY-AWESOME-APP
    </pre>

**.NET Framework**

To run a self hosted application using OWIN or another kind of .NET Framework app that requires a TCP port, compile the app
to `myapp.exe` and use the Binary buildpack. For an example, see the following manifest: 

```
applications:
- name: MY-AWESOME-APP
  stack: windows
  command: cmd /c .\MY-AWESOME-APP --server.urls=http://0.0.0.0:%PORT%
```

**Console Apps**

Console apps are not recommended to run on Cloud Foundry because they do not normally run as a single instance and are not highly available. If you need to run a console app on Cloud Foundry, see [Console Applications](https://dotnet-cookbook.apps.pcfone.io/headless/console_app/) in the .NET Cookbook.

For information about deploying different types of .NET apps, follow the links in the table below.
