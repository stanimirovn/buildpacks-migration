This topic guides the reader through deploying a sample Ruby on Rails app to Cloud Foundry.

##<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

In order to deploy a sample Ruby on Rails app, you must have the following:

- A Cloud Foundry deployment
- The [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](../../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
- A Cloud Foundry username and password with **Space Developer** [permissions](../../concepts/roles.html#roles). See your [Org Manager](../../concepts/roles.html#roles) if you require permissions.

##<a id='clone'></a>Step 1: Clone the App ##

Run the following terminal command to create a local copy of the cf-sample-app-rails.
<pre class='terminal'>
$ git clone <span>https</span>://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cf-sample-app-rails.git
</pre>
The newly created directory contains a `manifest.yml` file, which assists CF with deploying the app. See [Deploying with Application Manifests](../../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#minimal-manifest) for more information.

##<a id='login'></a>Step 2: Log in and Target the API Endpoint ##

1. Run the following terminal command to log in and target the API endpoint of your deployment.  <%= vars.api_endpoint_book %>

    <pre class='terminal'>$ cf login -a YOUR-API-ENDPOINT</pre>

1. Use your credentials to log in, and to select a [Space and Org](../../concepts/roles.html).

##<a id='service'></a>Step 3: Create a Service Instance ##

Run the following terminal command to create a PostgreSQL service instance for the sample app.
Our service instance is `rails-postgres`. It uses the `postgresql-10-odb` service and the `standalone` plan.
For more information about the `postgresql-10-odb` service, see [Crunchy PostgreSQL](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-cloud-foundry/).

  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf create-service postgresql-10-odb standalone rails-postgres
  Creating service rails-postgres in org YOUR-ORG / space development as   clouduser<span>@</span>example.com....
  OK</pre>

##<a id='deploy'></a>Step 4: Deploy the App ##

Make sure you are in the `cf-sample-app-rails` directory. Run the following terminal command to deploy the app:

<pre class='terminal'>$ cf push cf-sample-app-rails</pre>

`cf push cf-sample-app-rails` creates a URL route to your application in the form HOST.DOMAIN. In this example, HOST is cf-sample-app-rails. Administrators specify the DOMAIN. For example, for the DOMAIN `<%=vars.app_domain%>`, running `cf push cf-sample-app-rails` creates the URL `cf-sample-app-rails.<%=vars.app_domain%>`.

The example below shows the terminal output when deploying the `cf-sample-app-rails`. `cf push` uses the instructions in the manifest file to create the app, create and bind the route, and upload the app. It then follows the information in the manifest to start one instance of the app with 256M of RAM. After the app starts, the output displays the health and status of the app.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push cf-sample-app-rails
Using manifest file ~/workspace/cf-sample-app-rails/manifest.yml

</pre>

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to view log activity while the app deploys, launch a new terminal window and run <code>cf logs cf-sample-app-rails</code>.

##<a id='bind'></a>Step 5: Bind the Service Instance ##

1. Run the command below to bind the service instance to the sample app. Once bound, environment variables are stored that allow the app to connect to the service after
a `cf push`, `cf restage`, or `cf restart` command.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf bind-service cf-sample-app-rails rails-postgres
  Binding service rails-postgres to app cf-sample-app-rails in org my-org / space dev
  OK
  TIP: Use 'cf restage cf-sample-app-rails' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
  </pre>

1. Run the following command to restage the sample app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf restage cf-sample-app-rails
  </pre>

1. Run the following command to verify the service instance is bound to the sample app.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf services
  Getting services in org my-org / space dev
  OK
  name             service             plan        bound apps            last operation
  rails-postgres   postgresql-10-odb   standalone  cf-sample-app-rails   create succeeded
  </pre>


##<a id='verify'></a>Step 6: Verify the App ##

Verify that the app is running by browsing to the URL generated in the output of the previous step. In this example, navigating to `cf-sample-app-rails.<%=vars.app_domain%>` verifies that the app is running.


You've now pushed an app to Cloud Foundry! For more information about this topic, see the [Pushing an App](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.
