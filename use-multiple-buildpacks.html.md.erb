title: Pushing an App with Multiple Buildpacks

This topic describes how developers can push an app with multiple buildpacks using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> As an alternative to the cf CLI procedure below, you can specify multiple buildpacks in your app manifest. This is not compatible with deprecated app manifest features. For more information, see <a href="../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html">Deploying with App Manifests</a>.</p>

For more information about pushing apps, see [Pushing an App](../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html).


## <a id='cfcli'></a> Specifying Buildpacks with the cf CLI

To push an app with multiple buildpacks using the cf CLI:

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must use cf CLI v6.38 or later.</p>

1. Ensure that you are using the cf CLI v6.38 or later by running:

	```
	cf version
	```
  	For more information about upgrading the cf CLI, see [Installing the cf CLI](../cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).

1. To push your app with multiple buildpacks, specify each buildpack with a `-b` flag. Run:

	```
  	cf push YOUR-APP -b BUILDPACK-NAME-1 -b BUILDPACK-NAME-2 ... -b BUILDPACK-NAME-3
  	```
  	Where:
  	* `YOUR-APP` is the name of your app.
  	* `BUILDPACK-NAME-1`, `BUILDPACK-NAME-2`, and `BUILDPACK-NAME-3` are the names of the buildpacks you want to push with your app.
  	<br><br>
  	The last buildpack you specify is the **final buildpack**, which can modify the launch environment and set the start command.
  	<br><br>
  	To see a list of available buildpacks, run:

  	```
  	cf buildpacks
  	```
