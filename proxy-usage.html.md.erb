title: Using a Proxy Server
owner: Buildpacks

This topic describes how developers can use a proxy server with the buildpacks for their application.

##<a id='proxy-usage'></a> Use a Proxy

You can assign proxy servers to environment variables. Proxy servers can be used to monitor your application's traffic or to fetch your application's dependencies. 

A buildpack uses a proxy server if that buildpack contacts the internet during staging.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The binary buildpack does not use a proxy server because it does not access the internet during staging.
</p>

##<a id='env-variable'></a> Setting environment variables

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the Java buildpack, the <code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code> environment variables are not supported at runtime. The Java buildpack does not add the functionality to make proxies work at runtime.</p>

1. Add the following section to the `env` block of your application manifest YAML file:
	<pre><code>---
	  env:
	    http_proxy: http<span>://</span>YOUR-HTTP-PROXY:PORT
	    https_proxy: https<span>://</span>YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY:PORT
	</code></pre>
	Where:
	</br>
	<ul>
	<li> `YOUR-HTTP-PROXY` is the address of your proxy server for HTTP requests.</li>
	<li> `YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY` is the address of your proxy server for HTTPS requests.</li>
	<li> `PORT` is the port number you are using for your proxy server.</li>
	</ul>

1. Set the environment variables with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface's (cf CLI) `cf set-env` command:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf set-env YOUR-APP http_proxy "http<span>://</span>YOUR-HTTP-PROXY:PORT"
	$ cf set-env YOUR-APP https_proxy "https<span>://</span>YOUR-HTTPs-PROXY:PORT"
	</pre>
	Where:
	</br>
	<ul>
	<li> `YOUR-APP` is the name of your application.</li>
	<li> `YOUR-HTTP-PROXY` is the address of your proxy server for HTTP requests.</li>
	<li> `YOUR-HTTPS-PROXY` is the address of your proxy server for HTTPS requests.</li>
	<li> `PORT` is the port number you are using for your proxy server.</li>
	</ul>
