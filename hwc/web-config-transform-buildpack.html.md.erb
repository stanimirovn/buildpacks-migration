This topic explains how to use the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

* A Linux, Windows or MacOS development machine or VM.
* A foundation with Windows cells available to push to.
* A foundation with the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack installed.
* The Spring Cloud Services Tile

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Cloud Native Applications derive their configurations and settings from external sources, 
for example from config servers or by reading environment variables, etc.
Configuration settings are injected through Web.config files for applications that run on IIS, such as ASP.NET applications.

As per cloud native principles, configuration should not be included in build artifacts.

The .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack provides a solution to this problem by
using token replacement during ‘cf push’ staging.

To leverage the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack, complete the following procedures:  

1. [Identify Environment Dependent Configurations and Externalize](#tokenize)
1. [Create a Cloud Foundry App Manifest](#create-manifest)
1. [Add Web Config Transformations](#transformations)
1. [Move Config Settings to a Git Repository](#move-to-git-repo)
1. [Create a Configuration Service for Spring Cloud Config Server](#create-spring-cloud-service)
1. [Bind Config Service to App Using Manifest](#bind-service-to-app)
1. [Add ASPNETCORE_ENV Variable to App Manifest](#add-aspnetcore-env)
1. [Push the App by Parameterized Environment Name](#push-app)

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This buildpack can inject appSettings and 
    connectionStrings regardless of whether the replacement tokens are present in the <code>Web.Release.Config</code> file. 
    For more information please see <a href="#special-behavior">Special Behavior for appSettings and connectionStrings</a> 
    section below.
</p>

## <a id='tokenize'></a> Identify Environment-Dependent Configurations and Externalize

To use the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack you will replace your `Web.config` files' environment-specific settings 
with placeholder tokens, and externalize their values outside of your application.  

To tokenize your workload's environment-specific configuration settings, complete the following steps:  

1. Backup your application's `Web.config` file, and its transform files, 
for example `Web.config`, `Web.Debug.Config`, and `Web.Release.Config`.  

1. Identify configuration items in the `Web.config` transform files that are environment-dependent. These items need to be externalized.

1. Modify your transform files to use tokenized configuration items 
by replacing hard-coded values with tokens following the format `#{configPath:key}`.  
<br>
    For example, refer to the before and after tokenizing sample files, below: 
<br>

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Transform xml attributes and tokens are case-sensitive.</p>

    **Before tokenizing**
<br><br> 
    Web.Config

    ```xml
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="MyDB" 
             connectionString="Data Source=LocalSQLServer;Initial Catalog=MyReleaseDB;User ID=xxxx;Password=xxxx" />
    </connectionStrings>
    ```
<br>
    Web.Release.Config

    ```xml
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="MyDB" 
             connectionString="Data Source=ReleaseSQLServer;Initial Catalog=MyReleaseDB;User ID=xxxx;Password=xxxx" 
             xdt:Transform="SetAttributes" 
             xdt:Locator="Match(name)"/>
    </connectionStrings>
    ```
<br>
    **After tokenizing** 
<br><br>
    Web.Config (no change)  
<br>
    Web.Release.Config

    ```xml
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="MyDB" 
             connectionString="#{connectionStrings:MyDB}" 
             xdt:Transform="SetAttributes" 
             xdt:Locator="Match(name)"/>
    </connectionStrings>
    ``` 

## <a id='create-manifest'></a> Create a Cloud Foundry App Manifest 

Perform the following steps to test your tokenizations by using environment variables in the Cloud Foundry app manifest
to perform the token replacements. 

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Token replacements with environment variables is solely for testing purposes
    to ensure your tokens are correctly replaced. 
    After validating using environment variables you will externalize your configuration settings 
    using git repositories and Spring Cloud Config Server in later steps below.
</p>

### <a id='create-manifest-app'></a> Create a Cloud Foundry App Manifest for Your App  

To create a Cloud Foundry app manifest for your workload, complete the following step:  

1. Ensure your application has a Cloud Foundry manifest file. If your application is in Cloud Foundry, you can create the manifest file 
    by running the following command:  

    ```
    cf create-app-manifest APP-NAME
    ```

    Where `APP-NAME` is your app's name.

### <a id='modify-manifest'></a> Modify Your Cloud Foundry App Manifest  

To configure your workload's Cloud Foundry app manifest for token replacement, complete the following steps:  

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You should prepare your Cloud Foundry app manifest for token replacement with debug/development 
environment connection values. 
</p>

1. Backup your app manifest file.  

1. Open the app manifest file in a text editor.

1. Add a reference for the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack to the manifest file's `buildpacks` 
property.

    ```yaml
    buildpacks:
    - WEB-CONFIG-TRANSFORM-BUILDPACK
    - hwc_buildpack
    ```

    Where `WEB-CONFIG-TRANSFORM-BUILDPACK` is name of the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension buildpack 
    in your foundation. Confirm the buildpacks in your foundation by using `cf buildpacks`.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure the new entry precedes the existing 
      <code>hwc_buildpack</code> buildpacks entry.
    </p>

  
1. Add `key:value` pairs to the manifest for each the Web Config file's tokenized settings.  
<br>
    For example, the following provides connection string values for a Web Config 
    file's`#{connectionStrings:MyDB}` placeholder:

    ```yaml
    applications:
    - name: sampleapp
      stack: windows
      buildpacks:
      - WEB-CONFIG-TRANSFORM-BUILDPACK
      - hwc_buildpack
      env:
        "connectionStrings:MyDB": "Data Source=ReleaseSQLServer;Initial Catalog=MyReleaseDB;User ID=xxxx;Password=xxxx"
    ```

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Create as many <code>key:value</code> pair lines as are 
        needed by your application. The values you provide should be your debug/development 
        environment's connection values.
    </p>

## <a id='transformations'></a> Add Web Config Transformations

By default, all web apps and WCF apps are created with **Debug** and **Release** configurations and 
corresponding web config transformation files (`Web.Debug.Config`, `Web.Release.Config`).

1. Add required transformations to your `Web.Release.Config` file.  
<br>
   For example, the following `Web.Release.Config` has been edited with transformations:  

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <!-- For Cloud Foundry -->
    <configuration xmlns:xdt="http://schemas.microsoft.com/XML-Document-Transform">

      <connectionStrings  xdt:Transform="Replace">
        <add name="MyDB" connectionString="#{connectionStrings:MyDB}" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
      </connectionStrings>

      <system.serviceModel>
        <client xdt:Transform="Replace">

          <endpoint 
            address="#{client:Default_IMyLogService:address}" 
            binding="#{client:Default_IMyLogService:binding}" 
            bindingConfiguration="#{client:Default_IMyLogService:bindingConfiguration}"
            contract="ServiceProxy.IMyLogService" name="Default_IMyLogService" />

        </client>
      </system.serviceModel>

    </configuration>
    ```

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong>  For developer machine debugging, use the <code>Debug</code> configuration profile 
        and your <code>Web.Debug.config</code> for transformation.
    </p>

1.  Build and push the application to Cloud Foundry to verify that your config settings are properly transformed:  

    ```script
    cf push
    ```

## <a id='move-to-git-repo'></a> Move Config Settings to a Git Repository  

A multi-environment, production-ready deployment configuration can be achieved by using Spring Cloud Config Server 
backed by a git repository data source.

To move your configuration settings to a Git repository, complete the following steps:  

1. Create a network-accessible Git repository specifically for storing this application's transform configuration files.  

1. Create a YAML file in your repository to hold your common settings across all environments. 
Name the file `YOUR-APPLICATION`.yaml.  
<br>
    Where `YOUR-APPLICATION` is the identifier name for your application.  
<br>
    For example:  
<br> 
    **sampleapp.yaml**  

    ```yaml
    appSettings:
      Setting1: "Common setting1"  
      ```

1. Create a separate YAML file for each of your unique app environments, for example your "Development", "Debug",
and "Production" environments, to hold your environment-specific settings. Name the files `YOUR-APPLICATION`-`APP-ENVIRONMENT`.yaml.  
<br>
    Where:  
    * `YOUR-APPLICATION` is the identifier name for your application.  
    * `APP-ENVIRONMENT` is the identifier name for a unique environment, such as "Development", "Debug" or "Production".  
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> You will later use these app environment names as values for the
    <code>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</code> environment variable to target different environments.
    </p>
  For example:  
<br> 
    **sampleapp-Development.yaml**

        ```yaml
         connectionStrings:
           MyDB: "Data Source=devserver;Initial Catalog=mydb;User ID=serviceacc3;Password=PaKsAsEwWoOrOdT3"
        ```
<br>
    **sampleapp-Production.yaml**

        ```yaml
         connectionStrings:
           MyDB: "Data Source=prodserver;Initial Catalog=mydb;User ID=serviceacc4;Password=PaKsAsEwWoOrOdT3"
        ```    
<br>
    Your configuration values are now present in your Git repository. They are also present in your `manifest.yml` file.
<br>
1. Remove your configuration key:value pairs from the `env` section of your `manifest.yml`.  
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>manifest.yml</code> <code>env</code> section should not include 
        any configuration key:value pairs during the next step.
    </p> 

## <a id='create-spring-cloud-service'></a> Create a Configuration Service for Spring Cloud Config Server

The .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack requires a configuration file pointing to your transform configurations 
Git repository.  

1. Ensure you have a config server available in your CF marketplace. To confirm the name of the config server available in your CF Marketplace, run the following command:  

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

    Review the return and determine whether you have either `p.config-server` or `p-config-server`.  

1. Create a JSON text file for configuration server settings. 
Add a single entry to the JSON file for the uri to your configuration Git repository.  
<br>
    For example:

    ```json
    {
        "git" : { 
            "uri": "https://github.com/ACCOUNT-ID/CONFIG-REPO"
        }

    }
    ```

    Where:  
    * `ACCOUNT-ID` is your Git repository account ID.  
    * `CONFIG-REPO` is the name of your configuration Git repository created in the step above. 

1. Save the text file as a JSON file, for example `config-server.json`.  
   <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure file is not BOM-encoded.</p>
1. To create a config server using `cf create service`, and your configuration file, run the following command:  

    ```script
    cf create-service CONFIG-SERVER-MARKET standard SERVER-NAME  -c .\CONFIG-FILE
    ```

    Where:  
    * `CONFIG-SERVER-MARKET` is the name of the config server, either `p.config-server` or `p-config-server`, 
    available in your CF Marketplace.  
    * `SERVER-NAME` is the name for your config server.  
    * `CONFIG-FILE` is the filename of your server config json file.  

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf create-service p.config-server standard my_configserver  -c .\config-server.json
    </pre>


## <a id='bind-service-to-app'></a> Bind Config Service to App Using Manifest 

Your app manifest file must be modified so it accepts configuration values from your externalized Git repository values.

1. Backup your app manifest file.  

1. To bind your config server to your app, add a new `services` section to your app manifest file with the following format:

    ```yaml
    services:
    - SERVER-NAME     
    ```

    Where `SERVER-NAME` is the name for your config server.  
<br>
    For example:  

    ```yaml
    ---
    applications:
    - name: sampleapp
      stack: windows
      buildpacks: 
        - web_config_transform_buildpack
        - hwc_buildpack
      services:
      - my_configserver
    ```

## <a id='add-aspnetcore-env'></a> Add ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT Variable to App Manifest 

1. To configure your config server so that it can target the correct configuration in your Git repository, 
add the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable to the `env` section of your app manifest with the value of `((env))`.  
<br>
    For example:  

    ```yaml
    ---
    applications:
    - name: sampleapp
      stack: windows
      buildpacks: 
        - web_config_transform_buildpack
        - hwc_buildpack
      env:
        ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: ((env))

      services:
      - my_configserver
    ```

## <a id='push-app'></a> Push the App by Parameterized Environment Name 

You can now push your app using your parameterized configuration.

1. To push your app, run the following command:  

    ```script
    cf push --var env=ENVIRONMENT
    ```
<br>
    Where `ENVIRONMENT` is the environment you wish to target, for example `Development`, `Production`, `QA`, or `UAT`. 
    The specified environment should be present in your Git configuration repository.
<br>
    For example:  

    ```script
    cf push --var env=Production
    ```

1. To confirm your app is running with the correct environment,
review your logs for `WebConfig Transform Buildpack execution`:   

    ```
    ================================================================================
    =============== WebConfig Transform Buildpack execution started ================
    ================================================================================
    -----> Using Environment: Production
    -----> Config server binding found...
    ```

## <a id='special-behavior'></a> Special Behavior for appSettings and connectionStrings

This buildpack makes it possible to externalize appSettings and connectionString values in your Web.config 
without using tokenized values. 

To externalize Web.config values without tokenizing, perform the following steps:  

1. Copy the contents of the `YOUR-APPLICATION`.yaml file in your Git configuration repository.  
1. Add the copied content to all of the Git configuration repository's environment-specific 
`YOUR-APPLICATION`-`APP-ENVIRONMENT`.yaml config files.  
<br>
    For example:
<br>    
    **sampleapp-Development.yaml**

    ```yaml
    appSettings:
      Setting1: "development setting"
     connectionStrings:
       MyDB: "Data Source=devserver;Initial Catalog=mydb;User ID=xxxx;Password=xxxx"
    ```

    **sampleapp-Production.yaml**

    ```yaml
    appSettings:
      Setting1: "production setting"
     connectionStrings:
       MyDB: "Data Source=prodserver;Initial Catalog=mydb;User ID=xxxx;Password=xxxx"
    ```  
1. Follow the instructions in [Push the App by Parameterized Environment Name](#push-app) 
above to deploy your application using the .NET Framework Web Config Transform Extension Buildpack.
